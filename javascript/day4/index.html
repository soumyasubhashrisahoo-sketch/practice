    <h1>DOM - Document Object Model</h1>

    <h2>what is DOM?</h2>
    a programming interface that represents a web page's structure (HTML/XML) as a <h3>tree</h3> of objects, 
    allowing scripts like JavaScript to <h3>dynamically access, change, add, or delete content, structure, 
    and style</h3>, making websites interactive without reloading. When a browser loads a page, it builds this tree, 
    treating each HTML tag as a node, which scripts can then traverse and manipulate to create dynamic features 
    like animations, form validation, and real-time updates

    <i>dom is a heavy object - it takes time to load the dom object in the memory</i>

    <h1>why dom is like tree like structure ?</h1>
    because it maps the hierarchical, nested nature of HTML code into a parent-child node structure. 


    <h2>difference between  dom and html </h2>

    <h3> DOM Traversal</h3>
    DOM traversal refers to the process of navigating through the nodes of a DOM tree. 
    It allows developers to move from one element to another, such as from a parent element to its child elements, 
    or from a child element back to its parent. This is essential for accessing and manipulating specific elements in the DOM.  

    <h1>Hamburger Menu</h1>
    when we click on hamburger menu it shows the list of items
    when we click on cross icon it hides the list of items
    why is part of dom?
    because we are manipulating the html elements using javascript
