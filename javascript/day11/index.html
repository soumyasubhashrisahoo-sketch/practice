    <h1>UNIT 3</h1>
    <h1>JavaScript is single threaded synchronous(step by step)</h1>
    Javascript is not for heavy compuatraion we need java or c++ for that, js is for web development and it is single
    threaded,
    it can do one thing at a time, but it can do it very fast, it can also do multiple things at the same time using
    asynchronous programming,
    but it is still single threaded.
    <h3>what is single threaded multi-threaded</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Single-threaded: A single thread of execution is used to run the program. Only one task can be performed at
            a time.</li>
        <li>Multi-threaded: Multiple threads of execution are used to run the program. Multiple tasks can be performed
            simultaneously.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>what is synchronous and asynchronous</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Synchronous: Tasks are performed one after the other. Each task must wait for the previous task to complete
            before it can start.</li>
        <li>Asynchronous: Tasks can be performed independently of each other. A task can start before the previous task
            has completed, allowing for more efficient use of resources and improved performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>asynchronous style of coding</h1>
    We write asynchronous code when the code is of blocking nature ,<b>blocking natures of code</b> - whjen the code is
    taking too much time to run
    and it is blocking the execution of other code,
    for example, when we are making an API call, it is taking time to get the response and it is blocking the execution
    of other code, in such cases we write asynchronous code to avoid blocking the execution of other code.



    <p>
        <code>
    console.log("start");<br>
    function dowork(){   <br>
        console.log("doing work"); <br>
    }                     <br>
    dowork();             <br>
    console.log("end");   <br>
</code>
    </p>

    <h1> approaches to write asynchronous code</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Callbacks</li>
        <li>Promises</li>
        <li>Async/Await - before fucntion</li>
        <li>some functions are default like - set time out </li>
    </ul>

    set timeout is a default function in js which is used to execute a function after a specified time,
    it is an asynchronous function, it takes two parameters, first is the function to be executed and second is the time
    in milliseconds after which the function should be executed.
    <P>
        setTimeout(function(){ <br>
        console.log("hello"); <br>
        }, 2000); <br>
    </P>


    <p>
        <code>
    console.log("start");<br>
    function dowork(){   <br>
        setTimeout( () => {   <br>
            console.log("doing work"); <br>
        }, 3000);             <br>
    }                     <br>
    dowork();             <br>
    console.log("end");   <br>
</code>

    <h1>QUESTION 1-WHY WE NEED ASCHYNOROUS TYPE OF CODING </h1>
    <ul>
        <li>To avoid blocking the execution of other code while waiting for a long-running task to complete.</li>
        <li>So our apps and websites don't freeze while waiting for slow tasks to finish. </li>
        <li>To improve the performance and responsiveness of applications by allowing multiple tasks to run
            concurrently.,
            Asynchronous coding is essential to keep applications responsive and efficient by allowing long-running
            tasks—such as API requests,
            database queries, or file I/O—to run in the background without freezing the main thread or user interface
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>WHAT IS CALL BACK FUNCTION - AND HOW WE CAN USE IT TO GRAB CALL</h1>
    A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after the completion of that function. 
    It is a way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. 
    When an asynchronous operation is performed, the callback function is called once the operation is complete,
    allowing us to grab the result or status of that operation.
    






    setinterval is also a default function in js which is used to execute a function repeatedly after a specified time,
    it takes two parameters,
    first is the function to be executed and second is the time in milliseconds after which the function should be
    executed.
